  Provide a clear and consistent API: The library should offer a clear and consistent Application Programming Interface (API) for creating components. This would help developers better understand how to use the library and create components more efficiently.

  Offer complete documentation: The library should have comprehensive documentation that explains how to use each component, the available options, and how to integrate them with other systems.

  Design modular components: Components should be designed in a modular way to allow greater flexibility in creating and reusing components. This would also allow developers to focus on creating specific components without worrying about the functioning of other components.

  Facilitate scalability: The library should facilitate the scalability of components to allow developers to add new features more easily without having to rewrite a significant amount of existing code.

  Provide a complete testing system: The library should have a complete testing system that allows developers to efficiently test components and detect errors more quickly.

  In summary, the intent of the component library is to provide developers with an easy-to-use and flexible tool for creating independent and scalable components. The library should be designed in a modular way, have a clear and consistent API, and provide comprehensive documentation and a complete testing system to facilitate component creation and ensure quality.
